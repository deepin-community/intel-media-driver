Provides:
 va-driver
Description: VAAPI driver for the Intel GEN8+ Graphics family
 The VA-API (Video Acceleration API) enables hardware accelerated video
 decode/encode at various entry-points (VLD, IDCT, Motion Compensation
 etc.) for the prevailing coding standards today (MPEG-2, MPEG-4
 ASP/H.263, MPEG-4 AVC/H.264, and VC-1/WMV3). It provides an interface
 to fully expose the video decode capabilities in today's GPUs.
 .
 This package contains the video decode and encode driver backend for
 the Intel HD Graphics of the Intel Core processor family. The supported
 platforms include:
  * Broadwell
  * Skylake
  * Broxton
  * Apollo Lake
  * Kaby Lake
  * Coffee Lake
  * Whiskey Lake
  * Cannon Lake
  * Ice Lake
 .
 Only a limited set of encoders is available via this driver: JPEG
 (Skylake and newer), AVC (Boxton and newer), HEVC and VP9 (Ice Lake and
 newer). Media shaders are only available on Ice Lake and newer.

Description: Intel C for Media Runtime -- shared library
 cmrtlib is a runtime library needed when user wants to execute their
 own GPU kernels on render engine. It calls iHD media driver to load
 the kernels and allocate the resources. It provides a set of APIs for
 user to call directly from application.
 .
 This package includes the shared library.
